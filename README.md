# Simple Authentication Server

This is a simple authentication server written in Python using the `http.server` and `socketserver` modules. It provides basic registration, login, and password recovery functionality.

## Features

- Registration: Users can register by providing a unique username, email, and password.
- Login: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
- Password Recovery: Users can request a password reset by providing their username. A new password will be generated and sent to them.
- Two-Factor Authentication: After successful login, users are required to enter a two-factor authentication (2FA) code generated by an authenticator app.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `http.server` module (built-in)
- `socketserver` module (built-in)
- `urllib.parse` module (built-in)
- `os` module (built-in)
- `hashlib` module (built-in)
- `base64` module (built-in)
- `ssl` module (built-in)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/igor20192/authentication_app.git

2. Generate SSL/TLS certificates (`server.crt` and `server.key`) for secure communication (optional but recommended).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

   ```shell
   cd authentication_app

4. Check in and activate the Python virtual environment

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv env
   . env/bin/activate

5. Run the following command to start the authentication server:

   ```shell
   python auth_user.py

6. The server will start listening on the specified port (default: 8000) and serve the required HTML pages.
7. Access the server using a web browser at https://localhost:<PORT>, where <PORT> is the port number specified in the code.
8. Follow the on-screen instructions to register, log in, and perform other actions.
9. User registration go : https://localhost:8000
   Login : https://localhost:8000/login
   Change Password : https://localhost:8000/forgot_password
   Log out : https://localhost:8000:logout

## Implementation Description

1. In the code, the TLS protocol is implemented using the ssl module in Python. Here's how it goes:

   - Create an SSL/TLS context:

      ```shell
      # Create an SSL/TLS context

      context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
      context.load_cert_chain(certfile="server.crt", keyfile="server.key")

   This code creates an SSLContext object using the ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER protocol. The certificate (server.crt) and the corresponding key (server.key) are then loaded using the load_cert_chain method to ensure a secure connection.

   - Applying an SSL/TLS context to a socket:

      ```shell
      httpd.socket = context.wrap_socket(httpd.socket)

   This code applies the SSL/TLS context to the server's socket httpd.socket. Now the server will accept encrypted connections using the TLS protocol.
   - Server start:

      ```shell
      httpd.serve_forever()

   - After applying the SSL/TLS context to the socket, the server starts up and starts listening for incoming requests on the specified port. All connections will be protected by the TLS protocol.

Note: The TLS protocol requires a valid
certificate, which you must provide in the form of server.crt files
certificate and server.key key. Make sure you have the correct
certificate and key, or generate them with tools like OpenSSL.

2. In the presented code, user registration occurs as follows:

   - When the client sends a POST request along the "/register" path (in the do_POST method), the server requests the registration form obtained from the request body:

      ```shell
      content_length = int(self.headers["Content-Length"])
      post_data = self.rfile.read(content_length).decode("utf-8")
      form_data = urllib.parse.parse_qs(post_data)

   - Then data is retrieved from forms such as username, email and password:

      ```shell
      username = form_data["username"][0]
      email = form_data["email"][0]
      password = form_data["password"][0]

   - After that, a check is made for the minimum password length:

      ```shell
      if len(password) < 8:
         # Return an error message if the password does not match minimum length

   - Next, checks are performed for the uniqueness of the username and email address:

      ```shell
      if username in users:
         # An error message is returned if the username is already exists

      if email in (users[username]["email"] for username in users):
         # An error message is returned if the email address is already exists

   - If all checks are successful, the password is hashed and stored in the users dictionary along with other user data:

      ```shell
      salt = os.urandom(16)
      password_hash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac("sha256", password.encode(), salt, 100000)

      users[username] = {
      "password_hash": password_hash,
      "salt": salt,
      "email": email,
      }

   - At the end, a message about successful registration is returned:

      ```shell
      response_message = "User successfully registered."
      self.send_response(200)
      self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
      self.end_headers()
      self.wfile.write(response_message.encode("utf-8"))

   Thus, when a user registers, the server validates the form data, performs several checks (including the password policy), hashes the password, and stores information about the user.
